    "ourStoryDescription": "Our story begins in the fall of 2024, when we were tasked with creating a project for our third semester. We wanted to create something that would have a positive impact on society, and after much brainstorming, we decided to create a voting software. We believe that voting is a fundamental right, and that everyone should have the opportunity to participate in the democratic process. We hope that our software will make voting more accessible to everyone, and that it will help to create a more inclusive and democratic society."
